# Today Matters

**Today Matters** is a dignity-first Android and Wear OS application designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease.

The app provides a zero-friction, single-screen experience that allows users to log medication timing, contextual factors (sleep, stress, protein intake, exercise), and passive tremor data — without guilt, judgment, or unnecessary complexity.

## Key Principles
- Accessibility-first, single-screen design
- Offline-only, privacy-first (no cloud, no accounts)
- Emotion-aware feedback ("Smart Empathy" engine)
- Open-source and free forever

## Tech Stack
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Room (SQLite)
- Wear OS (passive sensor logging)
